    <h2>Buttery garlic chicken and potatoes</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>2 Coles Graze Grass Fed Australian Beef Porterhouse Steaks </strong>(about 300g each)</li>
        <li><strong>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</strong></li>
        <li><strong>3/4 cup (185ml) dry red wine</strong></li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup (125ml) beef stock</strong></li>
        <li><strong>90g cold butter</strong>, chopped, divided</li>
        <li><strong>600g brussels sprouts</strong>, halved, outer leaves removed</li>
        <li><strong>Coles Finest by Laurent Multigrain Sourdough Vienna</strong>to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season steaks generously with salt and pepper. Heat a large frying pan over high heat. Add oil, then steaks. Cook for 3 mins each side or until browned and internal temperature is 50Â°C for medium-rare doneness. Transfer to a board to rest.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to medium-high heat. Add wine and simmer for 2 mins or until reduced by half. Add stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 4 mins or until reduced by half. Remove pan from heat and whisk in 30g of the butter, a few cubes at a time, to blend. Season.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in another large frying pan over medium heat, add brussels sprouts, remaining 60g butter and 1/4 cup (60ml) water.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 mins or until water evaporates and brussels sprouts are crisp-tender. Uncover and cook, tossing occasionally, for 5 mins or until golden brown and tender. Season.</li>
        <li>Divide brussels sprouts among serving plates. Slice steaks against the grain and place alongside brussels sprouts. Drizzle with pan sauce. Serve with the bread.</li>
